## Diamond Price Prediction Model

### Introduction About the Data :

**The dataset** The goal is to predict `price` of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including `id`):

* `id` : unique identifier of each diamond
* `carat` : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
* `cut` : Quality of Diamond Cut
* `color` : Color of Diamond
* `clarity` : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
* `depth` : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
* `table` : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
* `x` : Diamond X dimension
* `y` : Diamond Y dimension
* `x` : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:
* `price`: Price of the given Diamond.
